-- Claude Code spend, aggregated per DAY and per MODEL.
-- Run in Observability Analytics (Logging → Observability Analytics → Query) for project YOUR_PROJECT_ID.
--
-- Cost source of truth: the `cost_usd` label on each `api_request` event.
-- (The Cloud Monitoring metric is a per-session counter and undercounts totals.)
--
-- Companion to daily-spend.sql, which groups by user; this one groups by model.
