"""Deploy Vogue Concierge to Agent Runtime (the agent runtime).

WHAT THIS DOES
--------------
Packages the ``agents/`` team + the ``data/`` catalog and uploads it to Agent Platform
Agent Runtime, which then hosts and serves the multi-agent system for you (no
servers to run). The FastAPI app (``app.py``) and the A2A bridge both call this
deployed engine via ``stream_query``.

PREREQUISITES (one-time, in your own project)
---------------------------------------------
  * Enable the Claude models in Agent Platform Model Garden for your project + the
    region in CLAUDE_VERTEX_REGION (see agents/config.py).
  * Create the staging bucket below (or point STAGING_BUCKET at an existing one).
  * Have Application Default Credentials available (gcloud auth or a deploy SA).

RUN
---
    python deploy_agent_engine.py

It prints the new Agent Engine ID; set that as AGENT_ENGINE_ID on the Cloud Run
service that serves the UI (the printed gcloud command does this for you).
