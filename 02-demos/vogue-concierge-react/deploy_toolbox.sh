# Vogue Concierge — deploy the MCP Toolbox to Cloud Run.
#
# The toolbox exposes the BigQuery inventory/loyalty tools that the deployed
# agents call. deploy_agent_engine.py reads TOOLBOX_URL from the environment, so
# run this FIRST, then export the printed TOOLBOX_URL before deploying the agents.
# (bootstrap.sh does this chaining for you.)
#
# toolbox/tools.yaml ships with a `your-gcp-project-id` placeholder. We render a
# concrete copy into an isolated build context so the committed template stays
# clean and your real project id is never written back into the repo.
#
# SECURITY: the service is deployed WITHOUT public access. Callers present a
# Google-signed ID token and need roles/run.invoker on the service; the agents
# do this for you via the Toolbox ADK client's workload_identity strategy. The
# toolbox also runs as its own least-privilege service account that can only
# read BigQuery — not the Compute default SA, which is far broader.
