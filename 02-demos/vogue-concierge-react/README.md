# Vogue Concierge — AI Boutique (Claude on Agent Platform, React edition)

An elite AI fashion concierge built with **Claude models on Agent Platform**,
**Google ADK**, and **Agent Runtime**, fronted by a **React**
storefront.

This is an Anthropic + Google "better together" build: Claude does the reasoning,
Google Cloud provides the runtime (Agent Runtime), retrieval (Vertex RAG), and
structured data (BigQuery).

> **This demo is the React-only build.** It serves the concierge through a React
> UI and a FastAPI relay. A separate build adds a **Gemini Enterprise** surface
> (A2A + inline A2UI cards) on top of the same agent team.

## Quickstart — one command

The fastest path is the interactive installer. It deploys the whole thing into
**your own** Google Cloud project: it collects your config, enables APIs, seeds
the data plane (Imagen catalog, BigQuery, RAG), and deploys the MCP Toolbox, the
agent team, and the React UI — capturing every generated id into `.env` as it goes.

```bash
# In Cloud Shell (or any machine with gcloud + python3), from this demo's
# directory (02-demos/vogue-concierge-react):
./bootstrap.sh
```

The installer is **interactive and safe to re-run** — each step is idempotent, so
if something fails (a missing model, a quota bump) you fix it and run it again to
resume. The one thing it can't automate and will pause to walk you through is
enabling the Claude + Imagen models in Agent Platform Model Garden.

Prefer to run the steps yourself? See [Manual setup](#manual-setup) below.

## Architecture

```
React UI ──FastAPI (Cloud Run)──▶  Agent Runtime
                                        │
                                Orchestrator  (Claude Sonnet 5)
                                   ├─ Style Advisor       (Claude Opus 5)
                                   ├─ Inventory & Pricing  (Claude Haiku 4.5)
                                   └─ Returns & Care        (Claude Haiku 4.5)
                                        │
                          Vertex RAG · BigQuery (MCP Toolbox) · Catalog (GCS)
```

The **React UI** talks to `app.py` (REST/SSE) on Cloud Run, which relays to the
agent team on Agent Runtime.

## The right model for the right agent

Each agent runs on the Claude model that fits its job (configured in
`agents/config.py`, overridable by env var):

| Agent | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator / Concierge | `claude-sonnet-5` | Fast, excellent tool routing + a consistent concierge voice, `effort=medium` |
| Style Advisor | `claude-opus-5` | Deepest taste and trend reasoning (the showpiece), `effort=high` |
| Inventory & Pricing | `claude-haiku-4-5` | Fast, cheap, deterministic stock/price lookups |
| Returns & Care | `claude-haiku-4-5` | Quick policy answers and garment-care advice |

Sonnet 5 and Opus 5 have extended thinking on by default and default to `high`
effort, so both are set explicitly — `medium` on the orchestrator, which routes
and relays rather than reasons deeply, and `high` on the Style Advisor. Haiku 4.5
does not take an effort setting.

Claude runs on Agent Platform via `AnthropicVertex`, authenticated with Google
Application Default Credentials — **there is no Anthropic API key**.

## Prerequisites

You deploy this into **your own** Google Cloud project. Nothing here ships with
working defaults — the scripts fail fast until you configure the values below.

**1. Google Cloud project**
- A GCP project with **billing enabled**, and the `gcloud` CLI installed and
  initialized (`gcloud init`).
- Note your **project id** and **project number**
  (`gcloud projects describe <id> --format="value(projectNumber)"`).

**2. Enable APIs**
```bash
gcloud services enable \
  aiplatform.googleapis.com \
  bigquery.googleapis.com \
  storage.googleapis.com \
  run.googleapis.com \
  cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
  --project "$VERTEXAI_PROJECT"
```

**3. Claude on Agent Platform (Model Garden + quota)**
- In **Agent Platform → Model Garden**, enable each Claude model you use: **Sonnet
  5**, **Opus 5**, and **Haiku 4.5**.
- Confirm you have **quota** for them. `CLAUDE_VERTEX_REGION=global` routes to
  available capacity and is recommended; regional endpoints may lack Opus 5
  quota until you request an increase.

**4. Imagen 3 (required)**
- `scripts/setup_catalog.py` generates the 30 product images with **Imagen 3**
  on Agent Platform. Imagen must be **enabled/allowlisted** for your project. Without
  it, catalog setup will not complete — this is a hard requirement, not optional.

**5. Authentication & IAM**
- `gcloud auth application-default login` (ADC — no API keys anywhere).
- The identity running setup/deploy needs, at minimum: **Vertex AI User**,
  **Storage Admin**, **BigQuery Admin**, **Cloud Run Admin**, **Cloud Build
  Editor**, **Service Account Admin**, and **Service Account User**.
- The deploy scripts create the runtime identities for you:
  - `vogue-toolbox-sa` runs the MCP Toolbox with only **BigQuery Data Viewer** +
    **BigQuery Job User** — it reads the two tables and nothing else.
  - The Agent Runtime service agent
    (`service-<project-number>@gcp-sa-aiplatform-re.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
    is granted **Cloud Run Invoker** on the private Toolbox service.
  - The Cloud Run UI service account needs **Vertex AI User** and **BigQuery
    Data Editor/User**, since `checkout.py` writes orders from there.

**6. Local tooling**
- **Python 3.11+**, **Node.js 20+** (for the React UI), and **Docker**.

## Manual setup

`./bootstrap.sh` (see [Quickstart](#quickstart--one-command)) runs all of this for
you. Do it by hand if you want step-by-step control. Run from the repo root; the
scripts read configuration from environment variables, so export your `.env` first.

```bash
# 0. Configure — copy the template, fill in your values, and export them.
cp .env.example .env
#   edit .env: set VERTEXAI_PROJECT and PROJECT_NUMBER (at least)
set -a; source .env; set +a

# 1. Verify Claude is reachable on Vertex in your project
python tests/test_connection.py

# 2. Build the data plane (order matters)
python scripts/setup_catalog.py     # Imagen images -> GCS, rewrites data/products.json
python scripts/setup_bigquery.py    # inventory + loyalty tables from the catalog
python scripts/setup_orders.py      # append-only orders table
python scripts/setup_rag.py         # RAG corpus; PRINTS RAG_CORPUS_RESOURCE=<name>
#   -> copy the printed resource into .env as RAG_CORPUS_RESOURCE, then re-export:
set -a; source .env; set +a

# 3. Deploy the MCP Toolbox to Cloud Run (the deployed agents call it for the
#    BigQuery inventory/loyalty tools). PRINTS TOOLBOX_URL=<url>.
./deploy_toolbox.sh
#   -> set TOOLBOX_URL in .env, then re-export:
set -a; source .env; set +a

# 4. (Optional) run the agents locally with the ADK dev UI. The Toolbox from
#    step 3 is called over the network, so TOOLBOX_URL must be set here too —
#    your own ADC signs the ID token.
adk web agents

# 5. Deploy the agent team to Agent Runtime (needs RAG_CORPUS_RESOURCE + TOOLBOX_URL)
python deploy_agent_engine.py       # PRINTS AGENT_ENGINE_ID=<id>
#   -> set AGENT_ENGINE_ID in .env, then re-export
set -a; source .env; set +a

# 6. Deploy the React UI (Cloud Run)
./deploy.sh
```

`deploy.sh` and `deploy_toolbox.sh` require `VERTEXAI_PROJECT` and `PROJECT_NUMBER`
in the environment (the UI deploy also needs `AGENT_ENGINE_ID`) and will refuse to
run without them. When `deploy.sh` finishes it prints the public URL of your
storefront.

## What's exposed, and tearing it down

> **This is a demo, not a hardened deployment.** Two things it creates are
> reachable by anyone who has the URL:
>
> * **The storefront** — `deploy.sh` deploys the UI to Cloud Run with
>   `--allow-unauthenticated`, because the point is to hand someone a link. That
>   endpoint relays to the agents, so anyone who finds it can spend your Claude
>   and Agent Runtime quota. It has no login and no rate limit.
> * **The product images** — `scripts/setup_catalog.py` grants `allUsers` read on
>   the `<project>-vogue-concierge` bucket so the `<img>` tags resolve without
>   signed URLs. The bucket holds only generated catalog images, but it is public.
>
> The MCP Toolbox and BigQuery are *not* public — the Toolbox is deployed
> `--no-allow-unauthenticated` and reachable only by the Agent Runtime service
> agent. If you want the storefront closed too, drop `--allow-unauthenticated`
> from `deploy.sh` and put IAP or your own auth in front of it.
>
> **Delete everything when you're done** — the Cloud Run services, the Agent
> Runtime engine, and the RAG corpus all bill while they exist:
>
> ```bash
> gcloud run services delete vogue-concierge --region "$REGION" --project "$VERTEXAI_PROJECT" --quiet
> gcloud run services delete vogue-toolbox   --region "$REGION" --project "$VERTEXAI_PROJECT" --quiet
> python -c "import vertexai; from vertexai import agent_engines; import os; \
>   vertexai.init(project=os.environ['VERTEXAI_PROJECT'], location=os.environ.get('REGION','us-central1')); \
>   agent_engines.get(os.environ['AGENT_ENGINE_ID']).delete(force=True)"
> python -c "from agentplatform import rag; import vertexai, os; \
>   vertexai.init(project=os.environ['VERTEXAI_PROJECT'], location='us-west1'); \
>   rag.delete_corpus(os.environ['RAG_CORPUS_RESOURCE'])"
> bq rm -r -f --dataset "$VERTEXAI_PROJECT:vogue_concierge"
> gcloud storage rm -r "gs://${VERTEXAI_PROJECT}-vogue-concierge"
> gcloud iam service-accounts delete "vogue-toolbox-sa@${VERTEXAI_PROJECT}.iam.gserviceaccount.com" --quiet
> ```
>
> The surest cleanup is to delete the whole project, if you made one for this.

## How it's built

- **`agents/agent.py`** — the team: an orchestrator that delegates to specialists
  via ADK `AgentTool`. Each agent runs on ADK's built-in
  [`Claude`](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/models/anthropic/) model
  class, which speaks the Anthropic Messages API natively — tool-calling and the
  thinking-block round-trip a tool-use turn requires — and authenticates with
  ADC. Reasoning depth is set per agent with
  `AnthropicGenerateContentConfig(effort=...)`. That's the whole Claude
  integration: no custom `BaseLlm` to maintain.
- **`agents/prompt.py`** — one system prompt per agent.
- **`toolbox/tools.yaml`** — the BigQuery **reads**, declared as parameterised
  SQL and served by the MCP Toolbox on Cloud Run. `inventory_specialist` calls
  them through `ToolboxToolset`, authenticating with a Google-signed ID token,
  so the queries live outside the model and the service stays private.
- **`checkout.py`** — the BigQuery **writes** (loyalty discount → simulated
  payment → write order → credit points), run on the Cloud Run layer. The agent
  only *signals* intent; this is the "signal/execute" pattern. It's a deliberate
  split — money-moving logic stays off the model, and the storefront needs the
  result to render a confirmation — not a reachability limit.
- **`app.py`** — FastAPI server for the React UI; relays chat to Agent Runtime.
