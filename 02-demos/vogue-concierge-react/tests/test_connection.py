"""Test connection — Vogue Concierge (Claude on Agent Platform).

Validates that Claude is reachable on Vertex AI in your project. Run this FIRST,
before deploying anything else — if this fails, check that you enabled the Claude
models in Vertex AI Model Garden and that CLAUDE_VERTEX_REGION is correct.

Usage:
    python tests/test_connection.py

Auth: uses Google Application Default Credentials (no Anthropic API key). Run
`gcloud auth application-default login` locally first.
