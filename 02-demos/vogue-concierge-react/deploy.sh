# Vogue Concierge — deploy the React UI + FastAPI server to Cloud Run.
#
# This service serves the Next.js frontend and relays chat to Agent Runtime. The
# agents themselves are deployed separately with `python deploy_agent_engine.py`,
# which prints the AGENT_ENGINE_ID you pass in below.
#
# Auth note: Claude runs on Agent Platform via the service account's ADC — there is no
# Anthropic API key to set here.
