"""Vogue Concierge — configuration.

This is the single place to change *which* Claude models power *which* agent, and
where the supporting data services (RAG corpus, BigQuery, MCP Toolbox) live.

KEY IDEA: "the right model for the right agent."
------------------------------------------------
Rather than one model doing everything, each agent is matched to a Claude model
that fits its job. You can retune the whole system by editing the four model
constants below (or by setting the matching environment variables at deploy
time — handy for A/B testing models without changing code).

AUTH NOTE
---------
Claude runs on Agent Platform and authenticates with Google Application Default
Credentials (ADC). There is no Anthropic API key here — the previous per-request
token-refresh plumbing (refreshing an ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` every turn) is gone.
