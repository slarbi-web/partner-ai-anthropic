"""BigQuery-backed SIGNAL tools for the agent (run on Agent Engine).

IMPORTANT — where the real work happens:
The Agent Engine sandbox can reach Vertex AI (Claude, RAG) but NOT BigQuery. So
these tools do NOT touch BigQuery — they only validate input and SIGNAL intent by
returning their parameters. The Cloud Run layer (app.py for the React UI,
a2a/server.py for Gemini Enterprise) sees the tool call in the Agent Engine event
stream and runs the REAL BigQuery action there (`checkout.finalize_order` /
`checkout.loyalty_status`), where BigQuery is reachable.

  * `place_order`   -> Cloud Run runs the real checkout (payment, order row, points)
  * `check_loyalty` -> Cloud Run reads the real loyalty tier / discount / points

Both are TOP-LEVEL tools on the orchestrator on purpose: only top-level tool calls
appear in the event stream the Cloud Run caller reads. A tool nested inside a
sub-agent would be invisible to the caller.
