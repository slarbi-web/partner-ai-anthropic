"""Vogue Concierge — multi-agent definition (Claude on Agent Platform + Google ADK).

THE TEAM
--------
Instead of one model doing everything, we build a small team of ADK agents, each
on the Claude model that best fits its job (see ``agents/config.py``):

    vogue_concierge (Orchestrator, Sonnet 5)
      ├─ style_advisor        (Opus 5)     outfit / trend / recommendation
      ├─ inventory_specialist (Haiku 4.5)  stock / sizes / price / loyalty
      └─ returns_expert       (Haiku 4.5)  returns / exchanges / care

HOW DELEGATION WORKS (AgentTool)
--------------------------------
We wrap each specialist as an ADK ``AgentTool`` and hand those tools to the
orchestrator. From the orchestrator's point of view a specialist is "just a
tool": it calls the tool, the specialist runs its own model + its own tools, and
returns an answer the orchestrator relays to the customer. The orchestrator
keeps one consistent concierge voice throughout — it never hands the microphone
over, it delegates and reports back.

This pattern only became practical once we moved to Claude: the previous model
could not transfer between agents reliably, which is why the old build crammed
all three personas into a single agent. Claude's reliable tool-calling lets us
use the cleaner team structure.

WHERE THIS RUNS
---------------
``root_agent`` is the entry point Agent Runtime (the agent runtime)
loads and serves. ``deploy_agent_engine.py`` packages this module + data and
deploys it. Locally you can also run ``adk web agents`` to chat with it.

from google.adk.agents import Agent

# ADK ships first-class support for Claude on Agent Platform: ``Claude`` is a
# BaseLlm that talks to the models through Anthropic's official SDK
# (``AsyncAnthropicVertex``) over Application Default Credentials — no API key.
# It handles the things a hand-rolled adapter gets wrong, most importantly
# round-tripping thinking blocks with their signatures inside a tool-use turn,
# which the current generation requires because thinking is on by default.
# ``AnthropicGenerateContentConfig`` carries the Claude-specific ``effort``
# knob that the generic GenerateContentConfig has no field for.

# the mechanism behind orchestrator -> specialist delegation.

    queries live outside the model and BigQuery is never addressed directly
    from here.

    The Toolbox runs authenticated. ``workload_identity`` mints a Google-signed
    ID token for the Toolbox URL from whatever ADC the caller has, which covers
    both places this runs: the Agent Runtime service agent in production, and
    your own ``gcloud auth login`` credentials when you drive the tree locally
    with ``adk web agents``. Nothing is resolved until the first tool call, so
    importing this module never needs the Toolbox to be up.
